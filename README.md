# Bacterial Communities in Alpine Snowpack 

This repository contains R scripts for data analysis and filtered data for BioProject PRJEB94184, investigating bacterial community composition and chemical properties of seasonal snowpack in the Swiss Alps.

## Study Overview

Surface snow and underlying bulk snow samples were collected from 19 sites across three adjacent valleys. Microbial communities were characterised using full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and major ions and organic acids were analysed.

## Contents

- **Scripts**: R scripts for data analysis. Each script can be run independently.
- **Data**: Filtered OTU, taxonomy, and metadata tables.

## Unfiltered Data

Complete unfiltered OTU, taxonomy, and metadata tables are available on Zenodo:
